# SQLBuddy

**SEEKING NEW OWNER**
Since I am not activly using sqlbuddy anymore I will not maintain this fork. If you want to take it over, please let me know, I will happily hand it over.

-------------------------------------------------------

This fork tries to improve the overall usability and awesomeness of sqlbuddy. I will mostly be working on design and layout. If anybody is wants to contribute (especially in the area of php code improvements, db supports, features) I would be very happy.

INTRODUCTION

SQL Buddy is open source! Use of the application is governed by
a MIT license - see LICENSE file for details.

CHANGELOG

A list of changes made in this version is available online 
at http://www.sqlbuddy.com/releasenotes/

INSTALLATION

To start using SQL Buddy take the folder of unzipped files and 
ftp them to your server. I would recommend placing them in a 
folder such as http://www.yourserver.com/sqlbuddy/. But in
reality, it shouldn't matter where you put them or what you call
the folder.

If you are interested, there is a few variables in config.php that you
can change if you want to customize your installation. It is totally 
optional, and your setup will work just fine if you leave the values at
their defaults.

UPGRADING

To upgrade SQL Buddy, its probably best to delete the old version then
unzip the new version in its place.

KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS

There is a bunch of keyboard shortcuts available to speed up things like
navigating through results, editing rows, etc. A list of shortcuts is
available on the home tab after you login. If you find the shortcuts 
annoying and would like to disable them, there is a line in main.js that you 
can disable. Its about 50 lines down, and I have left a comment indicating 
which line you need to comment out.
